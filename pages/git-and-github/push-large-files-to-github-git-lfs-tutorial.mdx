#### What is Git LFS?

LFS is [Github’s Large File storage system](https://git-lfs.github.com/), Where Github provides storage service to file greater than **100 MB**, You might need this when working with a larger dataset. To get to know about the LFS storage space in your account you can go to **settings** in Github and click on **Billings and Plans.**

Github provides **1 GB of free** file storage for everyone, any files beyond that the user needs to pay as they go. The below is the Dataplan if you need to purchase one. Now let’s upload the bigger file to the Github Repository. We will discuss how to upgrade Github Data plan.

**Step 4:** Now add the below code and add all the files your required, as my dataset was there in **3 excel in Data Folder**, so I used t**he git add \*** command rather than adding the individual file.

**What’s the disadvantage of Git lfs?**

Everytime when the people pull or push to the repository it will cound towards the data store bandwidth and utilize the storage left, if auto debit is enabled the money will deducted from the account.

**What is the alternate way to push python file without using lfs?**

The best approach is store the dataset in different folder and push the python notebook to Github. Use Kaggle storage to do in more efficent way.

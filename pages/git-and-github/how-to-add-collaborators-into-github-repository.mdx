#### What is GitHub Colloboration?

[GitHub collaboration](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Collaborating-on-Projects-with-Git) is a space where you can invite another developer to your repository and work together at an organization level, splitting the task and 2nd person will have the rights to add or merge files to the main repository without further permission. Also, refer to this [Github Beginner guide.](https://recodehive.com/github-tutorials/) Lets look into how to add collaborators into Github

#### Let’s invite a Colloborator

In this post, we will create a new repository and invite a collaborator to our repository by sending an invitation. A detailed procedure on how to invite a collaborator to your [Github](https://recodehive.com/github-tutorials/) repository is mentioned below.

**Step 1:** Went to Git hub and created new Repository, Click on the + sign on top right side and drop down will appear click on New Repository.

Fatal: unable to access | Error: 403
------------------------------------

What will happen if the person not added you as a collaborator and you tried to clone the file and push the repository to the main file? It will lead to the error permission denied. So it’s important to give enough permission.

fatal: unable to access 'URL': The requested URL returned error: 403

#### FINAL VERDICT

In conclusion, I hope you enjoyed reading this article on “**How to add Collaborators into GitHub Repository?**”. Again inviting a collaborator to GitHub is good to approach, but making the changes and pushing to the main repository is not a good approach, instead, we create individual branches and push the work to branch and later merge to the main repository. In the next post, we will discuss how to create branching on Github. Signing off **[Sanjay Kv](https://recodehive.com/about-us/)**

This is a continuation of the previous post, We have already created a repository on the same, if not [refer to this](https://recodehive.com/how-to-host-a-website-using-github/) Tutorial to get started. We are going to give a custom domain to the website you have hosted before.

What is Custom Domain
---------------------

By default when you upload a repository and host using **GitHub pages**, It will be as shown below. If this is a company name or a static portfolio page this may not appeal well. So you will have an option to customize this with the domain you want to be, for example, **.com, .in, .io, etc**.

    repo-name.github.io

**Step 1:** We will be creating Custom Domain in Godaddy. For this head to [GoDaddy.com](https://www.godaddy.com/) and search for the domain you wanted and purchase it. Here you can see I have purchased the domain called [sanjaykv.com](http://sanjaykv.com/). Once you purchased a domain you can see the My products Dashboard like this.

**Step 2:** Head to **Manage my domain** under the My Products tab.

**Step 3:** Scroll down on the next page that will be redirected after clicking on **Manage My domain**, then click on **Manage DNS** as highlighted.

**Step 4:** Now you need to add the below, you may wonder why this change is required. Here you are going to redirect Github Server to the Custom Domain Godaddy server.

*   In the Type section “A” row update the (Points to) IP address to: **185.199.108.153**

**Step 5:** In the **CNAME** row with Name “**www**” input your gh-pages website (_username.github.io_). The Steps have been detailed in the below screenshots.

**Step 6:** click the “ADD” button and make 3 more Type “A” rows with the IP addresses of:

185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, 185.199.111.153

In the above screenshot, you have seen adding the IP of **185.199.109.153,** repeat the steps two more times to increase the **185.199.110.153, 185.199.111.153.**

Once you add, it will look something like this now.

**Step 7:** Now the things with Godaddy Dashboard are done. You need to add a CNAME file to the local repository and push it to the remote repository. I have used visual studio for this purpose.

**Step 8:** In the next step ad the custom Domain name in the repository.

**Step 9:** Save it Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub.

**Step 10:** Once you did the push, go to the settings of the GitHub repository.

**Step 11:** Make sure the Enforce HTTPS is checked. If not then SSL certificate. Once this is done your custom domain will work instantly.

Fixing the Error while Setup Custom Domain
------------------------------------------

You can confirm that your DNS is set up correctly by using **dig the command**, In case you are facing some issue has mentioned below or the custom domain not working. Make sure the CNAME pasted is correct or not.

    Dig custom-domain

#### What is Github?

[Github](https://github.com/Sanjayviswa) is a way of version control your software development using [Git](https://git-scm.com/), Github was founded in 2008 and recently Microsoft has bought the company now **Microsoft** is the **parent organization of Github**. So what do I mean by version control? When developing software the important hurdle is merging the version as part of development or update. Github helps developers in this perspective, this allows collaboration between the developers to work simultaneously.

#### Let’s create a Github Account

**Step 1:** Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com), You can see a signup option. Click on that Signup option

#### Understanding Github Conflicts

Let’s imagine a case where two developer working on one respository by creating 2 different branch and same code line and both of them pulled the file to main repository, Now the github is good understanding the code and merge the conflicts automatically but it fails understanding if developer has put any comments. Now Lets look into How to resolve merge conflicts in github.

#### Lets resolve Github Conflicts

**Step 1:** In case if you dont know how to do pull request in Github, [refer this blog.](https://recodehive.com/how-to-create-new-branch-and-merge-in-github/) Once you press compare and pull request, Github will look into the possibilties of merging that itself if not it will show developer to solve the resolve conflicts Manually.

**Step 2:** Click on Resolve Conflict Button

**Step 8:** Lets look into how to resolve these github conflicts. As highlighted in 1 there are 16 conflicts here, and these conflicts are highlighted as below. Here Github found there are codes to merge in the same lines, ```bash <<<<< sanjay represents your branch.``` Now if you want to keep the changes as it is just delete the below lines from your entire code base. Click and backspace will do the work.

```bash 
<<<<<<<< sanjay
========
>>>>>>> main
```
![Somebody has got merge conflicts in the file - those ```bash <<< and 
and >>>``` lines are how git shows its merge conflicts. To make it 
valid, you need to get clean up those, and in each chunk, pick one of the bits inbetween them: 
HEAD 
Either keep this line... 
. or this one. But not both!

## How to start with GitHub?

Whenever you create something exciting or something new on your own, you always want to show it to others. As programmers, we also want to show our projects and codes to others, but how? Many platforms will help you host your code and show it to others, such as **[Github](https://github.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/)**, etc. Many of them give you the facility to work on your code together as a team. Currently, Github is more popular than other above-listed platforms for **hosting your code**

What is GitHub?PRO AccountPush, Clone, PullFork

GitHub is a version control system that will help you to control the version of the project on a very large scale.

GitHub offers Premium account for use, Premium users get unlimited Github Repo time, Storage etc. To know more [check out](https://github.com/pricing) GitHub Pricing.

Pull – Helps to get the repository from remote system to your local system whereas push does the opposite, and clone makes a copy of the parent repo.

Fork in Github helps you to copy the repository from the parent and work on the copy you have created in your repository.

## What is Git?

For uploading your project to your Github account, you need to install Git first.  You might remember the relevance of the below picture from the previous posts, In other words, Git helps to do this version management of the files and coordinating work among the diverse team in the software development phase. Git is [an open-source project](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F) and developed in 2005 by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) and Junio.

## What is Version control System?

To understand the version control system, let me give you one example; sometimes, you wish you have a record that contains all the changes you made in your code or your project. The version control systems are software tools that record all of your changes in the files. It is like a database of changes. **Git is a version control system** that most developers prefer to use. We will see how you can upload your code on Github using Git.

To learn more about version control systems, [click here.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Contro) Still didnt get the version history, Look at the above picture where a directory has different files generated for the updates is not a good approach whereas using git commands (commit, push, pull) a version history single main file is created.

## What Github can do?

Here want we do is **staging** the files and doing the commit, You can **clone** the entire repository and create a branch and commit to that branch ask the main developer to merge the **branch**. when you clone in reality you are creating a copy of the real code/repository in your local environment.

**The fork** is a personal copy of the repo which is already present or uploaded in GitHub by a different user. Once you fork and make changes to the repository the changes will happen to your forked repo, not the real one.

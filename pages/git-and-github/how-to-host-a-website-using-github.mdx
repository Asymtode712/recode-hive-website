What is GitHub Pages?
---------------------

GitHub pages are additional functionality that GitHub provides to host the website from your account repository. GitHub allows you to use GitHub Pages features with any public Repository of yours. **You need the PRO version** of Github to make a Private repository to GitHub Pages. Even Github allows you to make custom domain hosting as well. The only disadvantage of this process is **only a static website is allowed.**

How to Host a Website from GitHub repository?
---------------------------------------------

**Step 1:** Make sure the index file is available in the root folder as highlighted. In the below scenario I have created a website on my local repository and pushed it to the remote. The main file is index.html here.

Once Published your sample URL to access the page will be like shown below.
```
http(s)://<repository-name>.github.io
```

This is a continuation of the [GitHub tutorial](https://recodehive.com/github-tutorials/) series, this article deals with how to make an Organization visible to the public in your GitHub Profile. If you haven’t joined any **organization on GitHub** suggested joining any of the organizations.

Now if you are not sure where you can see this Organisation it is highlighted below, you will find it mostly on the left side of the profile. I have given my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/sanjay-kv) for reference.

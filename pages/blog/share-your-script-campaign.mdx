What is Google Crowdsource?
---------------------------

Update: This Campaign is over.

Google Crowdsource is a non-code community from Google, to improve the Machine and diversify the AI through individual contributions. We use the Crowdsource app to do the contributions of different tasks such as translation, image label verifications, etc.

In this post, we will discuss the share your script campaign by Google.

What is Share your script Campaign V 2.0?
-----------------------------------------

Share your script is a campaign to collect diverse handwriting from contributors to help train Google’s Machine Learning. This will cover 15 languages in total whereas the previous pilot shares your script campaign covered 8 languages only: **Hindi, African French, Amharic, Bengali, Gujarati, Indonesian, Japanese, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Portuguese, Spanish, Tamil, Telegu, Urdu.**

In this campaign, we aren’t focusing on the number of contributions as such; we are looking for different types of handwritten text (as compared to many images of the same style).

It would be great if you could encourage community members (or even your friends and family) to contribute after they fill this form and by using correct labels while uploading through image capture in the app. More unique participants will help us in getting diverse handwriting styles, which will improve **optical character recognition (OCR)** models that power products like Google Lens.

Why do such Campaigns?
----------------------

OCR is a technology where electronically converts the text into machine-encoded text and it quite works fine in English, but what about your native language? Even if it works how much accuracy of conversion you are getting now?

For OCR Model to recognise hand writtern text, they need to identify diverse scripts and writing style.
So this campaign will be helpful to achieve through crwodsourcing as the name suggests.

1.Translating restaurant menu, sign boards when you visit new country.
2.Scanning and translating business cards
3.Reading text or separate from the docs and pdf.
4.Helping users with Low literacy to understand.
5.Enabling accesbillity for people who are blind.

What is open source?
--------------------

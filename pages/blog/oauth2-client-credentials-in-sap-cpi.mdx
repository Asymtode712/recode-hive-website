Overview
--------

SAP CPI provides various APIs out of the box which can be accessed from Integration Flows to perform a variety of operations. For Example, **[MessageProcessingLogs](https://api.sap.com/api/MessageProcessingLogs/overview)** is an out-of-the-box OData API provided by SAP that gives access to MPL data of Cloud Integration Tenant. This article shows how to access MessageProcessingLogs Odata API using **OAuth2 Client Credentials**. The data fetched can further be used to automate alert emails, generate reports, and many other real-life scenarios as per requirement.

Pre-requisites
--------------

*   An active SAP BTP account with a subscription to the Integration suite. Follow [this](https://recodehive.com/set-up-your-sap-cpi-trial-account/) blog to create a trail account for free.
*   The roles AuthGroup\_Adminisrator, AuthGroup\_BusinessExpert, and AuthGroup\_IntegrationDeveloper are assigned to the user.

Create Service Instance and Service Key
---------------------------------------

**Step 1:** Create a **Service Instance** of Type **API** and include Role “**MonitoringDataRead**“. [Check this article](https://recodehive.com/creating-instances-and-service-keys-in-sap-cpi/) to create Service Instance. The Only two differences from the above-linked post would be,

*   A plan under Step 2 will now be API.

*   Add “**MonitoringDataRead**” under roles in **Step 3**. This role is specific to the “MessageProcessingLogs” API. Other APIs might require different roles.

**Step 2:** Create a **Service Key** for the above-created Instance and Note down the **clientid, clientsecret, and Tokenurl.**

Creating Security Material

**Step 3:** Give a meaningful name.

Enter Tokenurl, client id, and client secret obtained in **Step 2** against respective fields.

**Scope:** If you have scopes, enter the same. If none, enter a **blank space**. (entering blank space is very important. Else it will throw an error. )

**Content-Type :** application/x-www-form-urlencoded.

#### Introduction

The very common question while buying a laptop is which series of processors to go with. The market provides a wide range of Laptops with a variety of processor combinations at various price ranges. The top rivals in the list are AMD with its RYZEN and Intel with its Core series.

AMD and Intel had always been each other’s underdog since the beginning.

> The technology changed, People changed, but competition still the same.

The requirement of a processor completely depends on the usage. High-end gaming requires better single-core performance whereas high-quality video rendering or video editing requires better multi-core performance.

#### Comparison

Let’s look into a comparison of similar ranged processors from both companies.

AMD runs on 7nm whereas Intel is still on enhanced 14nm. When compared to video editing, RYZEN showed 10% better performance. In gaming, RYZEN again topped by 7% better performance. In daily usage tests, both showed similar results.

#### Value for Money

These differences may not be prominent in real-life usage but what creates a difference is the value for money. As in table, for the same performance range, the Intel processor will cost you around 3k more. The processors also need a compatible motherboard. The Intel-compatible boards cost you 4k more compared to AMD. Summing up, the RYZEN series by AMD will save you around 8K.  
Moreover, the RYZEN processors are overclockable which makes them Gaming ready. The AMD also comes with better-integrated graphics compared to Intel.

#### Conclusion

Intel gives a good range of performance only at a higher price range whereas the same performance is obtained in AMD at a very low price. It’s high time to switch to AMD if you really want to save some bucks!.

The situation may not be the same when Intel comes to 7nm technology which they have not planned yet while AMD is growing consistently. The healthy competition between these two will surely be a reason for a better user experience.

> AMD is a real Boom. Go for it !

### GETTING STARTED

Trying to update the app and getting the below issue saying change your app’s target [API](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/API.html#:~:text=An%20application%20program%20interface%20\(API,user%20interface%20\(GUI\)%20components.) level? Why this is happening? what’s the solution? We will be discussing that in this blog. The issue is if you are releasing a new version of app after a long time, then the app won’t support the latest update device. So that’s where the API level upgrade required.

**Step 1:** Go to the Gradle Script and move to [Build Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/tutorial_using_tasks.html)(Module app) as highlighted below change to the latest [API](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/API.html#:~:text=An%20application%20program%20interface%20\(API,user%20interface%20\(GUI\)%20components.), currently the latest version is 28, change the version compile sdk to 28 same way change the target sdk version to 28.

    android {
        compileSdkVersion 28
        defaultConfig {
            applicationId "Your package name goes here"
            minSdkVersion 21
            targetSdkVersion 28
            versionCode 2
            versionName "2.0"
            testInstrumentationRunner "android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
        }
    

**Step 2:** Now you can see the new notification appear above the menu tab, saying sync the project. Click on Sync, this will automatically install the latest version of the SDK.

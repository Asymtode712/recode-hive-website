Have you heard about Google Crowdsource? Maybe many won‚Äôt be familiar with it, because it‚Äôs an unsung app of Google which released in the year 2016. This post will let you know more about the app and Crowdsource community. So if you are a first-time user then the application will look more like a [Gameified](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) and not that tough to use even for a non-technical person.

#### **What is Google Crowdsource** ?ü§î

Google Crowdsource is a crowdsourcing platform, As I mentioned before it has released in the year 2016 August 29th, currently online web version is available. There were different types of task which you can do, I prefer to call that as [microtasks.](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/autodraw) During the year Google tried to add different tasks to it such as Image capture tasks in the year 2018 and Assistant Tutor in the year 2020 etc.

#### What‚Äôs the need of such app?ü§î

The main reason for the need for Google Crowdsource is to make the internet a better place, for example, a Bad Quality image(unclear Image) and labeling can make the things worse for the machine to categorize with the existing Algorithms. So we need to create a huge amount of quality labeling and image contribution to the system to train the data set.

So let‚Äôs take a minute to understand the structure, so we are in the state of **[Machine learning](https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalunlocked/course/machine-learning-basics)** where the machine has to understand and differentiate between structured and unstructured data and perspective of machine perspective it‚Äôs a complex task to understand and extract the feature without any guidance of the real-world object. so whoever using the app will be replaced as a **feature extractor for example**, and will help to extract both structured or unstructured data passed, and Machine will do classification on that and prepare well-trained data set.

Maybe in some time in the future, this feature extraction step can be completely removed and machines can start processing the data by themselves either Structured Data or unstructured data like how the human brain is processing. This is called Deep Learning.

Why wait. [Have a look](https://crowdsource.google.com/images)üî•

As you see in the below picture, you can see open source contributed picture and assigned labels by the contributor, this is opensource images and if you want to train or build some cool apps you can use that as well. Also, you can add tags by clicking on the **+** icon. Also if you would like to use the 470k crowdsource user-contributed Dataset [click here.](https://research.google/tools/datasets/open-images-extended-crowdsourced/) This one comes to the category Annotated Image set.

Also if you are looking to download the images on a large scale for any personal project or curious to know what‚Äôs happening to the images you contribute then [click here.](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/extended.html) This link will give you all the Open Images Extended version 6.

_Major: Bachelor of Technology in IT  
Organization: [Tata Consultancy Services](https://www.tcs.com/)_

_My experience as TCS intern starts with cloud computing (COE) department from August 2018 to November 2018. One of the more rewarding things about this experience has been the ability to apply things that I learned in some of my classes. Though I was not assigned to any project but was indulged in hands-on learning about the ongoing projects of my senior colleagues. The engineers I worked with during my internship period treated me as a fellow engineer from the first day I arrived._

_This also came with the expectation to meet the responsibility of giving quality work in a timely manner also continuing to work according to company standards. This was an excellent experience for my first position to work with TCS colleagues._

> _It forced me to learn other kinds of technology like block chain while working with cloud ._

_I learned the exact process in cloud technology so got to know how to accomplish it and that was exciting. One of the other great aspects of working here was about flexibility. I had a weekly 3 days goal that I need to go office, and my seniors always made me comfortable about working time spaces. If I need a day off due to college-related work, I can easily take a day off to do so and make up the time when I am available._

_How can I forget about the large area cafeteria and Tambola games we used to have fun during free hours. My team never made me feel like a TCS intern, I was always treated like their office colleague._

_First of all the people I met and worked with here are some of the most respected professionals in the industry so the fact that I received the best training from them, I think, be a great asset for me moving forward. Second, the TCS is such a large organization that I was exposed to incredible learning opportunities. I believe it’s important to realize that no one expects you to have all of the answers when you start a job._

_They do expect you to consistently come to work, be on time, and demonstrate full concentration to work hard and to equally discover those answers. And if you are visioned that you are also willing to learn, people will respect you even more. The best way to be successful in this internship is to work well in a team and to develop a broad network of contacts. As far as I concern_ my experience as a TCS intern was amazing.

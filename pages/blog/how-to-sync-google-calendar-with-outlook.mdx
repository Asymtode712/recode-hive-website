I personally felt so much productive after syncing all my calendars to one place, before I may miss the calendar reminder as it’s scattered with different calendar applications out there.

#### Can I sync Google and Microsoft Calander?

Yes, you can do that for this you need to have a Microsoft calendar application, in this video, I’m using **[Windows  11](https://recodehive.com/how-to-install-windows-11-for-free/)** Dev channel **build 220000.51**, Microsoft calendar application is already available there, Mostly all the versions on Windows 8, 10 apps come along with the OS, if not download from the [Microsoft store.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/store/apps/windows)

**Step 1:** Go to Windows application by clicking on the start button, the click on the Microsoft calander application.

**Step 5:** In this window select the Google account and sign in with username and password, that’s it you are ready to go. It may take some time to sync the calendar. In a similar way, you can sync the office 365 calendar and Apple calendar, and Yahoo calendar. Quite simple and easy process right?

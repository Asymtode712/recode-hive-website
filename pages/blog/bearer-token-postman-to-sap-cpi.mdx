Overview
--------

The article shows the process of accessing an SAP CPI endpoint from the Postman client using **_Bearer Token_** as an Authorization mechanism.

Prerequisites
-------------

*   Roles to design, deploy, and monitor integration artifacts in SAP CI.
*   An [instance of Process Integration Runtime and Its Service Key](https://recodehive.com/creating-instances-and-service-keys-in-sap-cpi/).

Mocking a receiver
------------------

For the demo, I have created a simple integration flow to a mock receiver in SAP CPI. It uses an _**HTTPS sender adapter**_ and a _**Content Modifier**_ whose body is set to “**_This is a dummy receiver used for testing_**” ( _This will be the response that we will be expecting at the end of the demo_). The **_endpoint_** obtained by deploying the integration artifact looks as shown below.

**Step 1 :** Copy the end point and keep it handy to use as described in further steps.

Fetching Bearer Token
---------------------

**Step 2 :** Open [POSTMAN](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). Create a new request with the type **POST**. 

Fill the Request URL with _**tokenurl**_ obtained from **Step 10** of [this](https://recodehive.com/creating-instances-and-service-keys-in-sap-cpi/) post.

 **Under Authorization,**

**Type**: Basic Auth 

**Username**: Client ID 

**Password**: Client Secret 

Client Id and Client Secret you will get when you create Process Integration Runtime Instance. ( Refer to **Step 10** of [this](https://recodehive.com/creating-instances-and-service-keys-in-sap-cpi/) post ).

**Step 3:** Switch to t**_he Body_** tab. Select the radio button _**x-www-form-urlencoded**_.

**Key :** grant\_type

**Value :** client\_credentials

Click on **_Send_**.

You will get the Token as a response body as shown in the picture below. Copy the same.

The steps to get an access token is completed. The next step is to use the token as Authorization to access SAP CPI iflow using the endpoint captured earlier.

Using the Bearer Token as Authorization
---------------------------------------

**Step 4:** Open a fresh request in postman. Paste the _**endpoint**_ obtained in _**Step 1**_ into _th**e request URL**_.

**Operation:** GET.

Under _**Authorization**_, Choose Type as **Bearer Token**. Paste the Token received in **_Step 3_** into the Token space.

Click on **Send.**

You will receive the expected response. In my case, I am getting the content set in Content Modifier as a response.

This token can be used until it expires. The expiry period will be displayed when you fetch the token. Once the token expires, a new token has to be generated.

**TIP:** It is advised to set the Token as a variable for security reasons.

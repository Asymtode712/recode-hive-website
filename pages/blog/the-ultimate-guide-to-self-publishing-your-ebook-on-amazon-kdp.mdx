*   **Ink and Paper Type** – KDP books can be printed in normal color, premium color, or black and white. Although Standard Color is unavailable in the markets in Australia and Japan, it strikes a decent balance between price and quality. More vivid, clear color is offered by premium color.
*   **Trim Size** – your book’s dimensions as it will be printed.
*   **Bleed Settings** – Printing near or off the edge of a page is possible when your interior is set to “bleed.” It serves as a foundation for graphics and visuals. Unless there is a clear reason to use “bleed,” most texts use “no bleed.” The production cost won’t change if the bleed settings are altered.
*   **Paperback cover finish** – KDP supports glossy as well as matte covers.

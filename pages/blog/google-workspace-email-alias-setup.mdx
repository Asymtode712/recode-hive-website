#### Get the Free Google Workspace Email alias

So what is an Email alias, let’s take a scenario I have created an email alias (**support@recodehive.com**) if somebody sends me a message to the email alias it will get forwarded to my main account like **sanjay@recodehive.com**

**Step 1:** You need to have a Google Workspace account and need to [Log in to the account.](https://admin.google.com/) Then click on the Create an alternative email address (email alias) option under the user tabs.

**Example:** If **sanjay@recodehive.com** wants a support email id where users can reach out to sanjay via the product support page, so sanjay can use **support@recodehive.com**. This way it increases the credibility of the business. Domains like **info@recodehive.com** etc can be done in the same way. Mail sent to any of the address goes to one account and user have the feature to any of the id and reply.

Some sample emails alias are

*   newsletter@recodehive.com
*   support@recodehive.com
*   sales@recodehive.com

**Step 4:** Here is the example of an alias email sample sent from the common user ID. A similar way can create 30 Free Email IDs. Now there is another **issue while replying**, as per the current setup I have received mail to alias mail and when I click on reply mail will trigger from sanjay@recodehive.com which is my main account, and the user will get confused easily.

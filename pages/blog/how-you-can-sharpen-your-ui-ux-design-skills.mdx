Learn the Fundamentals
----------------------

The most important thing you can do is to be able to differentiate between the user interface and user experience. The user interface is the visible parts of your app and how it looks, including buttons, forms, and other navigational elements. User experience is everything else — how the app feels and behaves, from the moment a user opens it to the last interaction they have with it.

The user interface doesn’t matter if you don’t have a good user experience!

Focus on the Details
--------------------

Focus on the details. This is a big one. If you want to get your message across, you need to know what it is you’re trying to say and how best to say it.

**Know Your User** — The first step to understanding your users is to actually talk to them. You can do this by asking them questions, or even better listening. Asking questions is a great way to get feedback on what you’re building, and it’s also a great way to dig into the details of what they care about.

**Know Your Target Audience** — Once you’ve figured out who your users are, it’s important that you know why they use your product or service in the first place especially if it’s not obvious from their behavior on other platforms or in other apps. This will help guide your design decisions and help ensure that you’re building something that appeals specifically to them rather than just creating something that looks good but isn’t useful enough for users’ daily lives.

**Researching with human-centered methods** — It can help you understand your users better. A good example is user testing; this involves having participants use the product or service while being observed by a research team. The goal is to observe how people use it, what they like and don’t like about it, and how they react to various things.

**Tuning your senses** — will help you create an experience that people want to engage with. Make sure that everything you create has:

*   A clear message (what it is and what it does)
*   An accessible style (does it look good?)
*   A compelling value proposition (why should someone buy it?)

Stop being a perfectionist & Expand your design knowledge
---------------------------------------------------------

If you’re someone who is constantly striving for perfection, you may want to consider expanding your design knowledge to include UI/UX design. UI/UX design is all about creating user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces and experiences.

**Step 1:** These following steps guide you step by step to get the most out of this feature. Hand Raise feature will roll out soon, you can see this near the video call button. There will be an extra button with the Hand Raise feature, Once you click on that Host and other attendees can see who has raised the hands and upon the priority, they can manage the interactivity.

**Step 2:** A sample picture is given below, on the right, you can see the new section is added once any one of the meeting attendees click on that, once your turn is over then you can click again on the hand raise feature to disable it. This will let the host know no more questions from the Attendees’ side and he can move to the next topics.

**Step 4:** For more information, I have added the list of features according to the [Google meet](https://meet.google.com/) plan, if you don’t have Google Workplace you basically will be not having most of the features like the Recording option and 250 participant Video calling option. Please look at the image below to know the plan better.

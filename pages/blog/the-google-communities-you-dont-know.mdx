#### GETTING STARTED

Google is a dream for all the students and at least everyone in their college time wished to be part of this wonderful organization, some might have left it because of inability to code or some other reason, what if you can still be part of the Google community and contribute indirectly Google products? Amazing isn’t it. Let’s Explore some of the communities you might don’t know.

#### 1\. CROWDSOURCE BY GOOGLE

[Google Crowdsource](https://recodehive.com/my-day-at-google-campus-hyderabad/) is an amazing platform that helps to enable building a Machine learning Dataset. How? As the name suggests through crowdsourcing. I started with this community as a contributor and became an Influencer and that was a 3 year Journey with this Google community. As a reward invited to the **Google Singapore office** in 2020, All expenses on Google side. Now what you say?

You can access this [site on the](https://crowdsource.google.com/) browser and Google Playstore, the IOS app is still under construction. You can download the app for Android from below. [Click here to read about my Journey to Google HYD:](https://recodehive.com/my-day-at-google-campus-hyderabad/)

The app UI and as a contributor may sound very simple but the implementation and output in real-time are really huge, I’m hosting a Google crowdsource community event this Saturday: you can register to learn a bit about machine learning and how crowdsource working.

#### 2\. GOOGLE LOCAL GUIDE

The [](http://The Google communities you don't know!)[local guide](https://www.localguidesconnect.com/) is another amazing platform to help the Google maps, Have you wondered how the Google maps showing the nearby place listing around you, so that’s is done through Local guides. The people who are contributing to this community are called Local guides and there is a lot of rewards you will be getting for your contribution. I have received free **Google One 1 TB** storage and **Udemy, OYO** offers by doing contributions.

Use the **Google Maps** [application](http://maps.google.com/) -> You can see **contribute tab** -> start adding the nearby places and details, There are points for each contribution. Level up to **Level 10** that is 1 lakh contributions, currently there are nearly 1M active members in the community and people who are active in the community selected as **Moderators**. Cool isn’t it?

#### 3.GDG – GOOGLE DEVELOPER GROUP

[GDG is a developer group](https://developers.google.com/community/gdg), let me say it need not be a good coder to join this team, but most of the GDG has some joining criteria, you need to qualify that, then there will be an amazing world of developers open for you. How I used this platform is to learn and teach each other. [How to join](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzyGIdENFVT36Yx4zTws4kw) the GDG team is mentioned in the below video, If the GDG chapter is not there in your city you can request to start a new chapter in your area. Also by joining this team helps you to attend the official google events like Google developer days.

#### 4.GDE – GOOGLE DEVELOPER EXPERT

You might have amazing billion user apps long list and theses all platform have this [community forum](https://developers.google.com/community/experts) where you can ask doubts etc: For Eg: Google meet is a platform **Google Meet** has this forum where I as a user use this community to answer or ask questions and based on the active contribution your rank will get updated. Cool isn’t it? It’s not just over there are a lot of advantages of being part of this [community.](https://medium.com/firebase-developers/how-to-become-a-google-developer-expert-gde-a-practical-guide-83621d2c8087) You even get an invitation from Google to **Google IO event** happens in California Every year and all charges on Google side. Now, How do you feel about it?

Below I have given my I**nvitation to Google campus**, If you read it you can see all the expenses Google has been taken, Nothing motivating and cool than this for an aspiring Engineer. Right? Also, I want to remind you being an expert is not an easy way, there is a lot of struggles on the way.

#### 5\. GOOGLE STREET VIEW

[Google Street view community](https://www.google.com/streetview/) works similar way like Google maps, This gives us the opportunity to capture the picture surround us and upload in **Google Streetview app**. This will be a bit tiring process if you don’t have a 360 camera. There will be a yearly event that happens in a different country The last [Google Streetview summit](https://support.google.com/maps/thread/8678363?hl=en) happens in London. There is a chance you also can be part of the community if you work with passion.

Rewards sometime go to **31000$** and [more](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/). Cool right?

Unofficially there are communities available in [Google groups](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/hall-of-fame/) or Facebook groups to learn and grow each other. To be part of this program you need to know to **check the vulnerability** and resolve the issue as a draft and notify Google, If you Qualify they will give your reward for your findings.

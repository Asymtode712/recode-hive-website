#### What is COUNTIFS Function in Excel

The above COUNT function we used as a whole without any criteria, Now [COUNTIFS](https://exceljet.net/formula/if-cell-contains-this-or-that) will help to get the count based on certain criteria. Criteria can be number, text if criteria are expression should be specified in quotation mark. There are also wild card characters like? These are allowed to use as criteria,? used to match with the character in the criteria.

COUNTIFS(Name range, Crietria1)
=COUNTIFS(Name,A1)
=COUNTIFS(Year,2021)
=COUNTIFS(State,"Kerala") #for state = Kerala
=COUNTIFS(Year,">2011")  #for year greater than 2011

COUTNIF(B2:B7, <>1)     Not equal to 1
COUTNIF(B2:B7, "<>")     Not blank
COUTNIF(B2:B7, "")      Is blank

#### SUMIFS Function in Excel

It will count total values in the table. Helps to summarise the Data, order of selecting the range is one thing to keep in mind. Similar to COUNTIF formula criteria can be added to this. One disadvantage of SUMIF is it only supports one condition. Any Characters must be quoted with ” “.

SUMIFS(range, criteria)
SUMIF(A1:A10, ">1.2")    returns value greater than 100

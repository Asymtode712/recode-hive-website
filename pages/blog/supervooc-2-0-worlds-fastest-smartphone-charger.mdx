#### GETTING STARTED

Technology is all about evolution and adaptation. Mobile industry following the trend of new communication protocol, larger screen, high performance remain soar when comes to power consumption. The concern over the power issue grows as the world is seeing a transition from 4G to 5G.

#### WHAT IS SUPERVOOC 2.0

You might have observed the battery getting discharged even when the charger is plugged in. Ever wondered why.? The reason being discharge rate is more than the charging rate. High CPU usage drains the battery quickly than the input being fed via normal charger.

This is a serious challenge for the smartphone giants all over the world. Expanding the battery size is absolutely not encouraged: None likes weight. Expanding the capacity leads to longer charging time: Nope I have no time. Considering the above facts the only feasible way is to invest in fast charging.

A major breakthrough to this is brought by OPPO introducing [superVOOC 2.0 fast charger](https://www.oppo.com/en/newsroom/stories/the-road-to-developing-65w-supervooc-2-0-flash-charging-technology/) in its Find X2 and Find X2 Max.

SuperVooc 2.0 comes with an incredibly fast charging rate where one can charge 0-100% in just 38 mins. It uses 65W power input with 10V and 6.5 A quick charging.  
**Bingo!!** Now the customers can focus just on what they want without worrying about battery life.

**Worried about safety?! With such high input voltage and current?**

The mobile platform is an open system which makes controlling of fast  
charging impossible if the phone crashes. But new superVOOC 2.0 has an independent closed system fast charging platform which makes it safer than ever!. As they say, ” _**Efficiency is the goal, safety is a necessity**_ “.With this, the Supervooc 2.0 technology entitles itself as the first 5 stars certified fast charging technology by CTTL.

Well, now that sounds interesting. How did they achieve it?!

##### LOGIC BEHIND THE MAGIC!

The step down transformer generally integrated with mobile hardware is shifted to charging adapter thus reducing the heating.

*   The formerly used 5pin components are replaced by 7pin thus reducing charging time.
*   LVHC (Low Voltage High Current) technology is being used.
*   Dual 3C category cells of GaN are used which is the key hardware in VOOC 2.0 fast chargers.
*   GaN well known as modern generation semiconductor lead used in cells has more reliability, performance, and speed.

##### REFERENCE:

SuperVOOC 2.0 with all mentioned characteristics and patents is expected to lead the mobile industry in near future.  
With fast growing technology and innovation one shouldn’t be wondered if a day comes where ull need to charge for an hour and use the device for weeks!

#### FINAL VERDICT :

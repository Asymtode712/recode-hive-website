#### Prerequisites

1.  You should have a purchased domain with if not yet done use the [tutorial to get one](https://recodehive.com/how-to-purchase-domain-for-a-website/).
2.  Must have a purchasing plan

#### Understanding Hosting Service

Before getting started with hosting a website, need to understand there is plenty of services available in the market now, few of the service are [Hostgator](https://www.hostgator.in/), [big rock](https://www.bigrock.in/web-hosting/), [GoDaddy](https://in.godaddy.com/hosting), [Siteground](https://www.siteground.com/). You should be careful before buying a hosting service because reliability is very important, you need to check the facts like **uptime** they are providing**, speed, latency**, etc. this all affects your website loading speed.

#### Let’s get started.

**Step 1:** Here I opted to go with [Hostgator](https://www.hostgator.in/) when comparing another service this provides a much low price and the price will go down more when you go for shared service. Open the Hostgator now you can see the plans as shown below, select the plan you would like to go with.

**Step 2:** Once you click on account it will ask you to create an account or signup with Google or Facebook to do what is convenient to you. Make sure you create the account and remember the password. We need to come back to do other configurations and setting up WordPress in Cpanel.

**Step 3:** Once you click on the signup it will ask you for the details, this details the service will use to print the invoice for the purchase every time you make through godaddy.

**Step 4:** Now it’s the tricky part if you have already purchased the domain enter on the left box if you don’t have a domain with you click on the right box and enter the domain you would like to buy. I’m anticipating that you already have a domain with you on hand so type the domain you own. Here I own a domain called [dataclimers.com](http://dataclimbers.com/)

**Step 5:** Here you can see o opted for a single Linux Hosting service with 10 GB space with 5 email accounts with 100 Gb Data transfer rate. You can also apply coupons while checking out. use [the link here](https://www.hostgator.in/coupons) to get some coupon codes.

**Step 8:** Click on the Name server Details, and get the server details. In this scenarion i have purchased my domain from Godaddy and Hosting server i purchased from the Hostgator, now need to link both. So Name server Details will help us to do this task.

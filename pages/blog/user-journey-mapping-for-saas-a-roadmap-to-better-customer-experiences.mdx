Key Touchpoints in the SaaS Customer Journey
--------------------------------------------

A typical SaaS customer journey can be divided into three key touchpoints: awareness and evaluation, onboarding and activation, and engagement and retention.

1.  Awareness and Evaluation: This is the stage where potential customers first learn about the product and start evaluating whether it meets their needs. This is a crucial stage, as it sets the foundation for the rest of the customer journey.
2.  Onboarding and Activation: Once a customer has decided to use the product, they will go through an onboarding process to get set up and start using it. This stage is critical for ensuring that customers have a positive first experience with the product and that they are able to use it effectively.
3.  Engagement and Retention: The final stage is all about keeping customers engaged and using the product over the long term. This stage is critical for retaining customers and ensuring that they continue to derive value from the product.

#### Prerequisite:

It’s a complete beginner course on flutter installation on mac. There are a few pre-requisites before heading with the installation which is given below.

1.  You need Flutter SDK for Mac
2.  Bash Terminal
3.  Android Studio Version 3 or above

#### How To Install Flutter :

**Step 1:** You need Flutter SDK for Mac, you can download that by [clicking here.](https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra/releases/stable/macos/flutter_macos_v1.2.1-stable.zip)  The size of the SDK for the Mac Operating System Comes around 460 MB. Make sure you download to the download folder.

**Step 2:** Open the Bash Terminal from your Mac Os, Please refer to the following image to see how to open the bash terminal. Installation of the flutter is completely command-based.

**Step 3:** Next Step is to Extract the SDK through Terminal, I’m Extracting to Applications Folder. So the Command will be like.

    $ unzip ~/Downloads/flutter_macos_v1.2.1-stable.zip

**Step 4:** I hope you have Unzipped the file into the Applications folder by now. The process will take a little time. Now you need to access the flutter through one path throughout. Need to add Flutter Permanently to your path.

     export PATH="$PATH:Applications/flutter/bin"
     echo $PATH

Paste the 2 Codes above one by one, while running the next code, if you can see the exact path of the flutter then the installation of SDK is completed.

flutter doctor

The flutter doctor will let you know whether the Installation has been done properly or not

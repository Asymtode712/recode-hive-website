This is a continuation of setting up an Account in SAP CPI, [Kindly refer to the previous post to create an Account](https://recodehive.com/setup-your-sap-cpi-trial-account-2/), In order to do the full function is SAP CPI you need to set up SAP CPI Trial account. New account trail offers 365 days rather than 30 days.

**Step 1:** Site Login: you need to log in to the below site to set up a tenant in the SAP CPI Tenant Trial account and **enter the trial account** as mentioned. Once you enter then a **dialog box will pop** asking the region to set up the server.

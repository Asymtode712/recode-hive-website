### GETTING STARTED

Keystore path and the password maintain is one of the fragile things in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). Recovering the forgotten Keystore path is easy in Android studio, but if you don’t remember the Keystore password then it will be really hard to recover it.

**Step 1:** Go to the [**Gradle**,](https://www.techotopia.com/index.php/An_Overview_of_Gradle_in_Android_Studio) Mostly you can find on the right side of the IDE. Gradle helps while testing and development and it automate the task in Android Studio.

A few information about Gradle, because I believe the developer should know the IDE and its usage to perform amazing tasks. Gradle is basically doing the automation as we mentioned above, build on Java. It also helps to configure the libraries and automation as I mentioned above.

**Step 2:** Click and expand the **app section**, go to verification and click on **lintDebug**, Now there will be Event Log running down the IDE. Now again a small information regarding lintDebug, this is the one which helps in checking the possible bugs, the performance of the code, etc.

**Step 3:** Here you can see the **Keystore path**, Just a reminder this only will give you default Keystore path, it doesn’t give you details about the old path.

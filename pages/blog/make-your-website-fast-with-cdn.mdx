#### GETTING STARTED

There is a lot of things you can do as a blogger to improve your website speed, this includes purchasing a nearby server of your region, and convert into Webp image format, use a lightweight template. Now CDN(Content Delivery Network) is the new way to make your website load faster.

#### WHAT IS CDN?

CDN is known as Content Delivery Network, So before going into details you need to understand how the page delivers all your request. Suppose if a user from Singapore is requesting or enter to a webpage that is hosted in US server, then what’s happening is the user is downloading the webpage from the US serve  
In order to fetch the data from this long and show it to your system it takes time, this is known as latency. Here comes the CDN role which makes the server load less by distributing the content in the nearby server as per the usage.

#### HOW IT WORKS?

In order to make your website serve the user fast, CDN helps you to reduce the distance by storing the cached version of the website in the version in multiple geographical areas. Eg: POP, a.k.a  
Every POP contains caching servers responsible to serve CDN in the region. Means your content is distributed all over different geographical areas.

#### LINE CHART IN TABLEAU

We use Line Chart with continuous variable and it’s a common data visualization method for stocks price prediction, Analysing Growth of company website, etc. It helps the user to visualize the trend over time.

Let’s look at this scenario, we need to find out **how many movies per year are recorde**d in our dataset. You can download the dataset from the above link and open it in the Tableau desktop/ Public version. Drag and drop the In Theaters (year data) to Columns, The data is in [discrete forma](https://www.cuemath.com/data/discrete-data/)t, need to make it [continuous](https://www.isixsigma.com/dictionary/continuous-data/).

To make it continuous click on the Year Columns as highlighted below and select the 2nd Year, Now the Data header will be continuous, and can see the change in the Table below.

**Step 1:** Now you can see those changed Year from headers to the axis, All you need to do is there is count data generated by tableau which will appear in Italic, you need to drop that to row. A below-line chart will be getting. Here you may have noticed we have not selected the Line chart anywhere, it’s is because **it will be automatically assigned** as we have selected Automatic on the Marks.

**Step 2**: It’s true that the above line graph Is not visually appealing, you can see more analysis by dragging **genre** to Color and Number of critic ratings to the size. Again this selection purely depends upon what you want to visualize. The same way can assign the Labels to the data by drag and drop.

#### How to Sort a Chart in Tableau

Sorting is a pretty forward step, Hover the mouse over the left side of the chart will show a graph icon, clicking on that will make the sorting in both sending and descending orders.

#### How to Rename a Sheet in Tableau

By default, the new sheet will be named like sheet 1, sheet 2, but when you have multiple sheets involved in real-time projects or reports this can be messy the easiest way to do this is right-click on the sheet you want to rename and select the rename option and give a new name. Similar way you can Delete, Duplicate a Sheet in Tableau.

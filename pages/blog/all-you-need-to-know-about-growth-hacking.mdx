What is Growth Hacking?
-----------------------

Growth is a redefined version of marketing, Though it sounds different the function is the same but here the primary importance is given to the growth. Coming to 2020, **positioning yourself on the Internet** is very important, so growth hacking helps you to leverage the technology to sustain your business on a large scale.

For example: Imagine you plan to start a startup and the first thing that comes to your mind is to position yourself in the market by **analyzing your competition** and implementing a marketing strategy. All this will come under [Growth Hacking](https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/02/defining-a-growth-hacker-three-common-characteristics/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9hcHAuZnJhc2UuaW8v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACdnK6tfOHnQ5ik11K2dw3ysoVeZroILN1_ZVtVdB7L9lvUnpTWlbGc6QoeaQ0edWCb8due2dCQ0u-IyIxuqDQ8eXLe_GZiZ5hiUlAysyh4pGmIngjf4O7le7vHgyo6fsXnN9Ag42TD-CBupaDxlu7hW4PqcLnqVgcV7qp9aZLEl).

The Term Growth Hacker
----------------------

Heres comes to the growth hacker who has the desire to connect with your target and find a solution to it and establish a huge growth. I have seen growth hackers coming with engineering backgrounds and they are doing great in the field. So don’t just get the bad vibe that [Growth Hacking](https://www.startup-marketing.com/where-are-all-the-growth-hackers/) is just for non Engineering people.

In common all the leading Growth Hacker characteristics include the ability to take the growth responsibility and ability to **generate leads** using leveraging the latest technology and a lot of patience. One thing to keep in mind is the growth won’t be sudden. Maybe you can reach maximum people with promotion, but I would ask to get more **organic growth** which takes time and a lot of patience.

The Difference Between Traditional Marketing 
---------------------------------------------

The typical traditional Marketing approach is like running ads but when it comes to growth hacking there are a lot of marketing ideas like [content engagements](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/growth-hacking/), OPN (other people network), Automation, using the growth Hack Tools as well. People generally misinterpret both the terms differently.

Growth Hacking is much relevant in the startup community because the raising company won’t have budget safety when they need promotion and scaling to a **large audience**. Typically this includes optimization, content outreach, marketing, Automation like driving customers with a landing page and through other people’s networks as I mentioned above.

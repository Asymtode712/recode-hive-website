#### Introduction

Data Store operations are a way of Persisting messages to access the same at a later point in time.

**Hypothetical Scenario :** Data processed by an integration flow (iflow1) needs to be fetched by  another integration flow (iflow2) within 5 days.  

**Solution** : Use Data store operations ( Note : The Data Store mentioned here is a pallet object available in SAP CPI integration Flow and NOT SAP Cloud Platform Integration for data services)

In this example, We will create two flows; One to Store the data ( StoreFlow), another to retrieve data ( ConsumeFlow ) and understand its working.

#### Configuring StoreFlow

**Step 1 :** Create two Integration Flows. One that stores the message (**_StoreFlow_**) and other that consumes the stored message (**_ConsumeFlow_**). 

![i-Flows](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-15-1024x240.png)

**Step 2 :**  Open **_StoreFlow_** in edit mode. Connect **Sender to Start** event and Choose **HTTPS** protocol and Configure the adapter as below. 

![HTTPS](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-16.png)

**Step 3 :**  Use a **Content Modifier** to Add EntryID as Header which will be used in Write step and body as below.

![Content Body](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-17.png)

**Step 4 :**  **Select Persistence –> Data Store Operations –> Write** from the pallet

![Data Store Operations](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-21.png)

**Step 5 :**  Configure the write step as below. 

**Name of the Element** 

**Value** 

**Description** 

Data Store Name 

D1 

Data Store will be created at runtime with this name 

Visibility 

Global 

_Global_ : It can be accessed by any  integration flows.   
_Integration Flow_ : It is local to the integration flow. 

Entry ID 

${header.EntryID} 

The Name with which the message will be stored under Data Store Name. Multiple Messages can be stored under a single Data Store Name. In this case, the Name will be chosen from incoming message _orderNumber_ stored as header in _**Step 3**_ .

Retention Threshold For Alerting ( in d) 

5 

The stored Message has to be consumed within these days from the date of creation of Data Store Entry. 

Expiration Period (in d) 

90 

The Data store will be deleted after 90 days. 

Encrypt Stored Message 

Yes 

To encrypt the stored message 

Overwrite Existing Message 

No 

To overwrite the message with same Entry ID if it already exists. 

Include Message Headers 

No 

To include message headers while storing the message

**Step 6 :** The final Flow will look as below. **Save and Deploy** the Flow. 

![Data Store WRITE](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-34.png)

**Step 7 :**  From the **Overview Window –> Manage Integration Content –> Started** . Copy the End Point URL of StoreFlow. 

![End Point](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-23-1024x220.png)

#### Postman Settings

**Step 8** :  Open [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) app.  

Keep the request in **GET** mode. 

Paste the Endpoint copied in **[Step 7](#Step 7)** in to **URL tab**. 

In **Authorization** tab, Choose **TYPE : Basic Auth** 

**Username** : Client ID 

**Password** : Client Secret 

Client Id and Client Secret you will get when you create Process Integration Runtime Instance during tenant setup. ( Refer **Step 34** of [this](https://recodehive.com/set-up-sap-cpi-tenant-in-trial-account-2/) post )

**Or**  

 ( If you have followed [these](https://recodehive.com/access-iflows-using-trial-account-login-credentials-in-postman/) steps that allows one to access flows using Tenant Login Details) 

**Username :** Tenant Login ID 

**Password :** Tenant Login Password 

**Body :** 

    <Order_MT> 
             <orderNumber>1</orderNumber> 
             <supplierName>Walt</supplierName> 
             <productName>Timber</productName> 
    </Order_MT> 

![Payload](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-27.png)

**Step 9 :** Click on **Send** 

**Step 10 :** Go to Overview Window. Check if message is delivered successfully. 

![Monitoring](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-30-1024x256.png)

**Step 11 :** Under Manage Stores tile of overview window, Click on **Data Stores.**  

![Data Store](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-22.png)

**Step 12 :**  Verify your entry with the Values assigned in **Step 5**. 

![Data Store](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-26-1024x192.png)

##### **Explanation**

The Data Store will have **Name** D1. 

**ID** will be “1” because the incoming Message had productNumber as 1. 

**Status** is “waiting” which means the Stored message is not Consumed yet. 

**Due Date** will indicate the Date by Which the Message needs to be Consumed (5 days as configured). 

**Created At** will indicate the date and time of the creation of the Message. 

**Retain Until** indicates the date by which the Entry gets deleted automatically. 

**Message ID** helps to navigate to the related messages. 

The operation of StoreFlow will end here. We need to create Consumer Flow (ConsumeFlow) to consume this stored Data. 

#### Configuring the Consumer Flow

**Step 13 :** Open **ConsumeFlow** in Edit mode. Replace Start Even with **Timer Start Event** and Configure it to start based on your preference. I have configured to start as soon as the flow is deployed. 

![Timer](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-29.png)

**Step 14 :**  Add a **Data Store Operation ( GET )** and Configure the Values as below. 

**Field Name**

**Value** 

**Description** 

Data Store Name 

D1 

Name of the Data Store from where the Message is to be fetched. 

Visibility 

Global 

_Global_ : If the message is to be extracted from the message ID of Other flow.  
 _Integration Flow_ : If the message is to be fetched from the same flow message ID. 

Entry ID 

1 

The Entry ID of the message. It is hardcoded 1 for demo purpose as in earlier step, the ID of stored message is  

Delete On Completion 

Yes 

It will Delete the Message  

Throw Exception on Missing Entry 

Yes 

It will  throw error if the Entry ID is not present in the Data Store mentioned in Data Store Name. 

![GET](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-24.png)

**Step 15 :**  Add a **Groovy script** to log the payload to verify the output. 

    import com.sap.gateway.ip.core.customdev.util.Message; 
    import java.util.HashMap; 
    def Message processData(Message message) { 
        def body = message.getBody(java.lang.String) as String; 
        def messageLog = messageLogFactory.getMessageLog(message); 
        if(messageLog != null){ 
            messageLog.setStringProperty("Logging#1", "Printing Payload As Attachment") 
            messageLog.addAttachmentAsString("ResponsePayload:", body, "text/plain"); 
         } 
        return message; 
    } 

**Step 16 :** The final flow will look as below. **Save and Deploy** the flow. 

![ConsumeFlow](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-25-1024x322.png)

**Step 17 :** In the **Overview Window**, Make sure that the Integration in **Started**. 

![Endpoint](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-31-1024x248.png)

**Step 18 :**  Click on the **Completed Message**. Under **_ConsumeFlow–>Attachments_**, Click on **Response Payload** 

![Monitoring](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-32-1024x349.png)

**Step 19 :**  Verify the Output to be same as the message that was stored earlier. 

![Payload](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image-33.png)

**Step 20 :** Navigate to the Manage Stores. As per the Configuration used in **_Step 14_**, the Entry Will be **deleted** after successful retrieval of the Message.

Try out various possible configuration combinations to understand the working.

Similarly experiment with Select and Delete Operations.

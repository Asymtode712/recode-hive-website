Overview
--------

The article shows the process of accessing an SAP CPI endpoint from the Postman client using **_OAuth 2.0_** as an Authorization mechanism.

Prerequisites
-------------

*   Roles to design, deploy and monitor integration artifacts in SAP CI.
*   An [instance of Process Integration Runtime and Its Service Key](https://recodehive.com/creating-instances-and-service-keys-in-sap-cpi/).

Mocking a receiver
------------------

For the demo, I have created a simple integration flow to a mock receiver in SAP CPI. It uses an _**HTTPS sender adapter**_ and a _**Content Modifier**_ whose body is set to “**_This is a dummy receiver used for testing_**” ( _This will be the response that we will be expecting at the end of the demo_). The **_endpoint_** obtained by deploying the integration artifact looks as shown below.

**Step 1:** Copy the endpoint and keep it handy to use as described in further steps.

Getting new Access Token
------------------------

**Step 2:** Open [POSTMAN](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). Create a new request with the type **GET**.

Paste the endpoint copied in **_Step 1_** into the **request URL**.

Under **Authorization**, choose Type as **OAuth 2.0**.

Scroll down to the ” **Configure New Token** ” section.

Fill in the details against the fields listed. The details can be obtained by following [these](https://recodehive.com/creating-instances-and-service-keys-in-sap-cpi/) (Step 10 ) steps.

**Token Name:** Any Valid name.

**Grant Type:** _Client Credentials._

**Access Token URL :**  tokenurl .

**Client ID :** _clientId_ .

**Client Secret**: client secret.

**Client Authentication:** _Send as Basic Auth header_.

Click on **Get New Access Token**.

Using the OAuth 2.0 Token
-------------------------

**Step 3:** You will get the Token as below. Click on **Use Token**.

Token gets added to the **Access Token** field.

**Step 4:** Leave header prefix as Bearer. Click on **Send**.

![Response](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image-7.png)

You should get the expected response. In my case, I am getting the content set in Content Modifier as a response.

You can also select **Password credentials** as **Grant Type** in **Step 2** and provide the _**user name**_ and _**password**_ in the respective fields. But to get the token successfully, the **Password credentials** must be included while creating an instance as described [here](https://recodehive.com/creating-instances-and-service-keys-in-sap-cpi/).

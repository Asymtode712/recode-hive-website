#### PREREQUISITES & MYTHS

Before getting started with SAP CPI Tutorials we have to understand what is SAP CPI(Cloud Platform Integration properly) The below are the misconception which you need to understand before dealing with CPI.

•HCI renamed to CPI – So both are the same, basically, there is a name change. If you refer to SAP [CPI Tutorials blog](https://www.udemy.com/course/overview-of-sap-cloud-platform-integration-cpi/)s you might encounter these words usually so don’t get confused.  
•CPI not PO software on the cloud.  
•IPAAS – Integration platform like syncing up data between 2 systems.Ex: SAP offers.

#### CLOUD SERVICES

(**IAAS**) Servers, VM’s, Networking, Storage, SAP HANA.  
(**PAAS**) Java Runtime Environment, SAP cloud, Middleware, Environment to write the code, and run it.  
(**SAAS**) SuccessFactors, Ariba, Concur is ready to use the software. You can buy the premium service and use it.

#### TYPES OF INTEGRATION

##### ON-PREMISE INTEGRATION

Integration within your landscape \* You can say local system integrating with each other

#### ON-PREMISE TO PARTNER SCENARIO

On your left, there is 2  scenario which is A2A •You need to send some file to the partner which is crossing your firewall and post the Message on the internet and into this partner, and all this security, encryption comes to pictures, • The partner is not your system it can be somebody else like supplier bank, etc.

•SAP connector helps to connect between your local system to cloud. Application in on-premise wants to talk to the cloud.

SAP ECC  Idoc to the connector then it will pass to CPI,  then that Idoc msg is converted to **EDI** msg **ANCI x12** or **EDIFACT** then EDI msg send over AS2 to the partner.

The integration tool is in the cloud not on the premise.

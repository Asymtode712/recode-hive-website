It enables customers to wirelessly stream their preferred movies, and videos from their phones into the in-car entertainment system.

This adapter may be connected to the USB port in the automobile and is simple to set up using the touchscreen or voice controls. We are going to describe the functionality magic the device could do to your car below provided with some offer code to purchase the device.

#### Why this accessory?

Most of the wireless adapters I have used are from 2022 model manufacturers and faced a few issues such as delays in response, frequent disconnections, and laggy video playback while using video apps. This may sound silly but the most tiring when you drive on busy road and navigation stops.

However, this [new device](https://blog.recodehive.com/Kaming) has a user-friendly interface with a perfect home screen menu, and it’s much more reliable than the previous models. It offers faster responses and consistent video streaming with Netflix and YouTube, with no lag.

The installation process is simple and straightforward. Once you connect it to the car’s USB port and select the device from Bluetooth, a beautiful interface pops up immediately. You can enter the Wi-Fi credentials to link the internet to the car, and you’re good to go. I mainly use built-in apps like YouTube, Netflix, and YouTube music, and the video playback is just like watching it on any other device.

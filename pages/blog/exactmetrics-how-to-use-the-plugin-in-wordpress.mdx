#### DISADVATANGE

*   ExactMetrics require CMS([content Management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)) like WordPress to function
*   Most of the features are disabled need the pro version to enable and for a personal blog, it’s not affordable.
*   Requires [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) version 4.9 or above

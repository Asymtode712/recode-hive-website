This tutorial will cover everything about installing Hadoop in Ubuntu in a simple and easy way, some of the prerequisites are **10 GB of space on** your laptop and some idea about the terminal commands in Ubuntu.

**Step 1:** We check with the terminal whether Java is installed or not with Java or not with command

**java -version**

**Step 2:** After this, we update the ubuntu terminal with the below commands.

**sudo apt-get update**

**sudo apt-get install update**

**Step 3:** Now we install the required JDK for the system  
**sudo apt-get install default-jdk**

Step 4: Now we check the JDK version that we installed.

**java -version**

**Step 5:** Now we create a separate user for the Hadoop configuration.

sudo addgroup hadoop

sudo adduser –ingroup hadoop hadoopusr

**Step 6:** Now use the following command:

sudo adduser hadoopusr sudo

**Step 7:** We need to install the SSH server with the following command.

sudo apt-get install openssh-server

**Step 8:** Now we should change the user to a Hadoop user and type the password.

su – hadoopusr

**Step 9:** Now we need to access the ssh key using the below command.

ssh-keygen -t rsa -P “”

![](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-40-1024x399.png)

**Step 10:** We should add the below command to authorize the keys.

cat $HOME/ .ssh/id\_rsa.pub >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized\_keys

**Step 11:** Now check for the local host i.e. ssh localhost with the below command and press yes to continue and enter your password if it asks then type exit.

ssh localhost

Now you have completed the basic requirement for Hadoop installation.

**Step 12:** We should download the Hadoop in the ubuntu system.

S**tep 13:** Once you have downloaded **Hadoop-3.2.2.tar.gz** then place this tar file. now we should extract the file.

**Step 14:** We extracted the hadoop file.

sudo mv hadoop /usr/local/hadoop

**Step 15:** Wher change hadoopusr

sudo chown -R hadoopusr /usr/local

**Step 16:** The main step while configuring the Hadoop in ubuntu are these steps.

sudo nano ~/.bashrc

**Step 17:** Before configuring we should check the java version

my case it is java-11-openjdk-amd64

![](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-49-1024x207.png)

**Step 18:** Now we will configure hadoop-env.sh. For that open the file using the below command.

sudo nano/usr/local/hadoop/etc/hadoop/hadoop-env.sh

![](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-50-1024x120.png)

![](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-51-1024x493.png)

**Step 19:** Now we will configure the core-site.xml. For that open that file using the below command:

sudo nano /usr/local/hadoop/etc/hadoop/core-site.xml

![](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-52-1024x133.png)

Once the file opens copy the below text inside the configuration tag.

**Step 20:** Now we will configure the hdfs-site.xml for that open that file using the below command.

sudo nano /usr/local/hadoop/etc/hadoop/hdfs-site.xml

![](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-54-1024x84.png)

![](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-55-1024x457.png)

**Step 21:** Now we will configure the yarn-site.xml which is responsible for the execution of files in the Hadoop environment. For that open that file using the below command:

sudo nano /usr/local/hadoop/etc/hadoop/yarn-site.xml

![](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-56-1024x59.png)

![](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/image-57.png)

**Step 22: Now the last file to configure is mapred-site.xml. For that,** we have mapred-site.xml.template so we need to locate that file then copy this file to that location and then rename it.

sudo cp /usr/local/hadoop/etc/hadoop/mapred-site.xml.template /usr/local/hadoop/etc/hadoop/mapred-site.xml

sudo gedit /usr/local/hadoop/etc/hadoop/mapred-site.xml

#### Which is the best tool to create an online course in WordPress?

We have come across the different LMS, I believe the [Fresh LMS](https://appsumo.com/freshlms-black-friday-2020/) is the best one based on the price and Feature they provide. it allows integration with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-in) and [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/in/home), So it allows you to receive payment from any platform and also provides [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) integration as well.

If you looking for [FreshLMS](https://freshlms.com/) alternative then [LearnDash](https://www.learndash.com/) is the best tool you can get in the market. LearnDash is an amazing tool and provides amazing Features and integrations as well but the cost is a bit high compare to another platform service. If you are a beginner and looking for something small to get started then [WPLMS](https://wplms.io/) is the best.

**Is it worth Buying LMS for WordPress?**

It’s up to your requirement if you have quality content structured like a course and getting 100$ then investing in the LMS is worth, because you get a predefined template.

**How to make online Tutorials?**

If you are using WordPress then you can use Learning Management system(LMS) like Lifter LMS, LearnDash, Fresh LMS or WPLMS.

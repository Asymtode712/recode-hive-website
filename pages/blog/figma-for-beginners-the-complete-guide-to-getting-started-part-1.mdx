By the end of this post, you’ll be ready to start creating beautiful designs in Figma. So let’s get started!

What is Figma?
--------------

Figma is a cloud-based design tool that enables designers to create, collaborate on, and share their designs. It’s a relatively new tool, but it’s quickly gained popularity among designers due to its user-friendly interface and wide range of features.

Figma is similar to other design tools such as Sketch and Adobe XD, but it has a few key advantages. First, Figma is browser-based, so you can access your designs from any computer with an internet connection. Second, Figma has built-in collaboration features that make it easy to work with others on your designs. And third, Figma is free to use (with some paid features).

What can Figma be used for?
---------------------------

Figma is an amazing tool for creating and sharing designs. It’s a great way to design, collaborate with others and share your work.

You can use it for your own personal projects, but there are lots of other ways you can use it as well:

1.  As a tool for prototyping: Figma is great for getting ideas out of your head and into the world. You can use it to quickly mock up a design or prototype in minutes — no Photoshop required!
2.  To share your work with others: Figma is perfect for collaborating on projects with other people and teams. You can connect with them easily through email, Slack or even through Figma’s built-in chat feature (more on that later).
3.  For creating UI prototypes: Figma has built-in tools that make prototyping UI incredibly easy (and fast). In this guide we’ll show you how we use them in practice — so you can get started right away!

How Does Figma Work?
--------------------

Figma is a vector-based design tool, which means that designs are created with mathematical equations instead of pixels. This makes it easy to resize and scale designs without losing fidelity.

Figma also has a few unique features that set it apart from other design tools. One of these is the ability to create responsive designs that adjust to different screen sizes. Another is the ability to create designs with real data. This is helpful for things like creating charts and graphs, or for testing design concepts with real data before implementing them. Finally, Figma has built-in collaboration features that make it easy to work with others on your designs.

You can leave comments on specific elements of a design, or you can chat with others in real time to discuss changes. Figma also has a version control system that lets you see who made what changes and when. This is helpful for keeping track of changes and for reverting back to previous versions if needed.

When you create a new project in Figma, you’ll be prompted to choose a template. Figma offers templates for a variety of design projects, including websites, apps, and user interfaces. For this example, we’ll choose the “App” template. Once you’ve selected a template, you’ll be taken to the Figma editor.

The Figma editor is where you’ll actually create your designs. The canvas, the layers panel, and the toolbar.

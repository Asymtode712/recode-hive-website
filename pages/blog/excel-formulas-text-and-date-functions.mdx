#### How to Extract spesfic text from a cell in Excel

**LEFT, MID, RIGHT** to fetch or extract data from a cell, this will be more useful in the Data Wrangling phase before Data Analysis, exception case find the pattern of data and use the Find function to extract the data properly. We can use the find function as a helper in the above functions, Find finds the location of the character specified.

*   LEFT – Helps to extract the data from the left
*   MID – Extract the mid values from the cell, need to define starting and ending positions.
*   RIGHT – Same like Left, it counts the pointers from the right side of the cell

\=LEFT(text,num\_chars)
=MID(text,num\_chars\_start,num\_chars\_end)
=RIGHT(text,num\_chars)

\=FIND("",D3)-4 //This will find the space in the text   and replace it over here =MID(text,num\_chars\_start,FIND("",D3)-4)

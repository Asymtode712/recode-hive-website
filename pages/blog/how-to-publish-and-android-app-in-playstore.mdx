There are two options for developers, [**beta release**](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7003180?hl=en) and store release, beta release allows you to make the app available to the limited use as part of the [pilot project.](https://www.apm.org.uk/resources/find-a-resource/what-is-the-difference-between-a-trial-and-a-pilot/#:~:text=The%20pilot%20project%20is%20an,viability%20of%20a%20project%20idea.&text=The%20pilot%20project%20enables%20an,before%20substantial%20resources%20are%20committed.)

#### Creating Privacy Policy for Google Play store

![](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-7.png)

Creating a **Privacy policy** is very important to get it reviewed by Google, What I have a developer used to do is generate a privacy policy and store it in Google drive generate a link, and paste it into the Google play console. To Generate a privacy policy you [can use this link](https://app-privacy-policy-generator.firebaseapp.com/)

Once you create your privacy policy you can copy the markdown file or save in word and upload in a publicly available link on internet, you can use github or Google drive for this purpose. Need to make sure that anybody can access the privacy policy.

Again Click on App content and do the same for News App. In Target Audience creation Click on the No for **Appeal to Children** button.

#### THE AI WORLD

From a simple audio-controlled device like Alexa to human alike robots, Artificial Intelligence(AI) is proving its dominance. The innovations and advancements in AI, have made our life much simpler and easier. A patented ‘predictive touch’ technology by [JLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_Land_Rover) adds another flavor.

#### WHAT IS PREDICTIVE TOUCH

Lazy to bend and reach display while driving? Just hover your fingers and the task is done!! Yes, it is quite amazing how the patented ‘predictive touch’ by Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) with the support of engineers at the University of Cambridge uses AI and sensors to make quick interaction with the displays in cars. The contact-less screen technology predicts the user’s intended selection just by hovering the finger mid-air, thus reducing the interaction time and efforts.

The tech aims at reducing cognitive distraction to drivers and letting them concentrate on the road ahead. The focus is not only to reduce road accidents but also to curb the pathogen spread from surfaces that could probably happen with touch screens.

#### TRIAL RESULTS:

On-road trials and lab tests showed the ‘predictive touch’ mechanism reduced drivers’ effort and time by 50 percent. However, the question is how effective this tech is when compared with voice-driven controls!. Is the algorithm that accurate to predict on its own? can it differentiate between the unintended gestures and intended ones?! with these questions, the “safety” is not pretty much insured.

> No technology is bad, it just has to be used at the right place and time

Even though the first thought to the above question inclines more towards the voice-driven AI, the ‘predictive touch’ mechanism is expected to be much powerful than stated in different use cases.

1.  As a replacement for daily use touchscreen devices with customization.
2.  In devices that do not have physical surfaces such as 2D / 3D projections.
3.  In [Holograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holography).
4.  No screen size restriction.
5.  No area of usage restriction.

In addition, there is no screen size and area of usage restriction for nonphysical displays. Since it can be projected anytime anywhere.

Maybe the usage might differ from intended but the invention will surely make its mark.

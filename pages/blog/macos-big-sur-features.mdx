We all knew the MacOS current version is Outdated and there was a need to sync UI with IOS and macOS. The new update has effects like **depth, Transparent, shading.** Also clicking on the menu bar helps to achieve all the functionality without navigating to the new screen.

#### 4\. The Stickies

You might remember windows vista here, However, this resembles those features but bit more advanced and easy **to use. As I** told you they tried to reduce the **UI gap** between the Apple **ecosystem** by doing so.

#### 5\. The Browser : Safari

Another major update happened to the browser safari, it’s no more the slow version. It has been updated with lots of chrome-like features and privacy. Another highlight is the company claims safari is 50% faster than Google chrome. We need to wait and see that.

Adding to these other features like 3rd party apps and **Extensions** also available in the Safari browser adding to that there is a translation feature. Currently, it supports 8 languages.

#### 6\. Privacy

In WWDC20 Apple has stressed privacy many times and there is a reason and they have implemented the same. There is a new **toolbar in the safari browser that** helps you to see all information the website has access to what they are doing with the data. That’s a leap on the Apple OS update.

Usually, all the mac software release happens in September and October month and due to covid19, we can expect this around **November** or **December 2020**.

#### How to get the beta version?

All you need to do is register for the beta version and you are good to go make sure this is a beta version and there will be bugs that can crash your mac, so would suggest if you are not a developer wait for the stable version in the market. You can log in here beta.apple.com. Also for the beta version login here [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/). apple will charge you ~100$ for developer access.

#### Compatible Devices with Big Sur

*   MacBook Air 2013+
*   MacBook pro 2013+
*   Macbook 2015+
*   Mac mini 2014+
*   Imac 2014+

If your Macbook is not compatible with the version listed and planning to buy a new version of mac then wait, because there is a huge hardware update going to happen in the Apple which is processor changing from **Intel** to **ARM.** So you should wait and see what is yet to happen.

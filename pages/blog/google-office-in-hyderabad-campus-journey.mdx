**It** was one of the biggest days of my life as one of my dreams came true. I recently had a great opportunity to visit the Google campus in Hyderabad. Apart from the joy I received entering the campus, meeting Googlers from different countries was a very good experience. It was an immense pleasure to even have a conversation with them.

I have been in too many companies like **Microsoft, HP, Mphasis, Cognizant,** and so on, but what makes **[Google](https://metro.co.uk/2018/03/16/took-tour-googles-magic-happens-dreamy-imagine-7337482/)** different is their work culture. However, I will describe each and everything about Google and how I got there.

14 April 2017: It all started from here, I accidentally found this on Google search “Crowdsource “! I Slowly started working on it, then realized that it became one of my hobbies where I can verify the transcript, labels, images, and more. For the first time, I have no idea how this gonna help internet/google or people all around the world.

### So what is Crowdsourcing?

This is an app released by the Tech giant Google on Aug 2016, it’s hardly been a year, what would this do? This is capable of another internet revolution. It can change how people use the internet every day.  
So, in short, it’s part of Google Artificial intelligence team, where Googlers provided tools such as transcript verification, image verification, there will be a bulk amount of data where it needs a massive human touch, this is where normal people like me and you come to play.

What you need to do is to verify the massive amount of data provided by Google and by your performance they will provide google badges, and accuracy rate also. I will describe how they will calculate the accuracy rate and all later.

### The Journey :

**Oct 15, 2017:** So it’s been hardly 6 months since I started working on this application/tools, on this fine day I got an invitation mail from one of the googlers “Reshma Sanghvi” from Hyderabad Google campus for their community meetup, first I thought this is something like that usually happens in all companies like “Gib2017 by Microsoft” which I attended March 2017, anyhow I decided to go there and see the campus, which was one of my dreams, so I gave my acceptance to the invitation received.

**Oct 24, 2017:** I was very curious about the meetup, The meeting was at Google Hyderabad. I currently reside in Chennai and Hyderabad is 400 miles far, I squandered all my savings and booked a flight from Chennai to Hyderabad.  
I reached there around 11:30, RGIA Airport gave me a different experience, the captivating beauty of the airport infrastructure is speechless. Anyhow, I reached google campus by 1:00.

Some photos of Google campus are attached…

This is the inside view of Google Campus Hyderabad. Amazing isn’t it? Okay, So let’s go back to the main thing, I will brief you about my experience there and then explain how you can do the same as I did.  
The Google company has developed distinct cultures of entitlement, wherever you go it same, be it California or Bangalore. People were more productive and very interactive, we met some Googlers in the lobby. They were very friendly to us, one googler was holding ice cream in his hand, and the other one doing something productive. They inquired about our visit and they exuded their happiness in what we did.  
More than this I felt everyone were super smart, more cafes than a workplace, which is even bigger than the work area and everything is free, whenever you get hungry, you go and grab your breakfast, lunch, dinner whatever it was, just like the product they develop they do care about the quality of the food they provide, everything is pretty awesome in google.

You can see the Googlers in this picture, the real heroes behind the Crowdsource application, the real question in front of us was how will I explain about crowdsource to people who are new to the internet or who don’t know about this unsung application, this is what I got from them.

> “Google Crowdsource is the key program in order to decrease gaps of understanding between languages using Machine Learning. This program is complement by an awesome mobile app and an excellent way to contribute. It’s easy to use and cool to help. It’s like a game but you are helping a lot at the same time! I’m grateful with this initiative.”

_According to my perspective knowing that I’m doing something to help google to provide better search results, is simply satisfying, and the possibility of this app that can contribute to Indian society is vast. Because we are the nation who fighting for the mother language with a vast variety of Indic language. Google said, ” even a small number of new translations and translation verification can really help Indic language translation.”_

_One more example for the people who didn’t get it._

Above picture showing the search image results for Flipkart you can see some irrelevant pictures, like phone and grinder,MI phone logo, it’s just the product they selling, this kind of machine error can be avoided by using crowdsource.  
_” So come join me and make the Internet a better place. “_

when I told him about the error I faced in transcription, he stopped me and started drafting mail about this problem to another Googler, this shows they love what they do, which is rare in other companies…

_What makes the google crowdsource special?_

I have corrected Google maps trails, streets, which was an active work which made a remarkable correction in their service, about crowdsource it’s all about the satisfaction that you receive, now you know each time you spend on this is gonna change or help someone out there, what else you want more than that, you are not getting paid still you are satisfied.

> Apple coming with ARM-chips:

One of the major announcements of this year’s WWDC is that Apple is coming up with its own chips based on an ARM that is Apple silicon chips. Currently, Apple using Intel chips in their machines. Apple Silicon (ARM) Coming Late 2020

> Apple’s priority is quality:

Apple has always made it clear that they always want to deliver high-quality products (Well get ready to spend a few more dollars!!) with these new chips we will be seeing a dramatic change in the performance and making the machines more energy efficient with increased battery life.

##### WHY THIS CUSTOMIZATION?

When the hardware and the software work in tune we see that any machine can work to its optimum level so these chips will be flexible on this end and make necessary customization. These chips will be built using neural engines and M.L accelerators. We will be also seeing an improved camera processor, cryptography acceleration, and more.

##### HOW IT WILL AFFECT THE DEVELOPERS?

Most of the major companies making their ways to run their apps on these new chips, developers can use Xcode beta to run their apps on this new chip in a matter of a few days. Apple has also come with a program  
for the developers {universal apps ready – link to website}.

Is battery efficiency and performance has anything to do with ARM processor? Get to know more about it, Read the blog.

##### SUPPORT AND INTEL APPPS ON NEW CHIPS:

Users who have mac devices that are currently running on the intel chips apple have made it clear that it will provide all the necessary software updates (No discrimination here). Applications made for the intel macs can be used on apple silicon and this is made possible by Rosetta 2 which is a translation process that happens internally.

##### WHEN IT WILL HIT THE MARKET?

The recent news says that in the fourth quarter of 2020 or in early 2021 we will be seeing macs running on apple silicon. Apple is also working on Second-gen Mac processors based on one A-15 chip.

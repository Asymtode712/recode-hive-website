#### INTRODUCTION :

This article covers SOAP Sender Adapter in SAP CPI, Testing Integration Flow using Postman Client, and Using Exception Subprocess to handle Exceptions in SAP CPI . 

The Demo shows what happens when an Exception occurs in an Integration Flow and how it can be handled using Exception Subprocess and optionally  how the error message can be sent to intended recipients using Mail Receiver adapter. 

#### CREATING ARTIFACT TO THROW EXCEPTION :

**Step 1** : Create an **Artifact**. Go to **Edit** mode.

**Step 3** : Go to **_Connection_** tab of **SOAP Adapter** and enter any relative address. ( _/Exceptions_ ). This is to generate end point for accessing the Integration Flow. Keep rest of the fields untouched.

**Step 4** : Add a **Content Modifier**. In **_Message Body_** tab, type as given Below. 

    <Result1> 
    
    ${in.property.Test}        ---> This line should throw error as there is no such invocation available 
    
    Integration Process 
    
    </Result1>

**Step 8** :  Open [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) app.  

Keep the request in **POST** mode. 

Paste the Endpoint copied in **[Step 7](#Step 7)** in to **URL tab**. 

In **Authorization** tab, Choose **TYPE : Basic Auth** 

**Username** : Client ID 

**Password** : Client Secret 

Client Id and Client Secret you will get when you create Process Integration Runtime Instance during tenant setup. ( Refer **Step 34** of [this](https://recodehive.com/set-up-sap-cpi-tenant-in-trial-account-2/) post )

**Step 9** : In **_Body_** tab, Choose **Raw** radio Button and from types, Choose **XML**. 

Paste the below sample XML code. 

    <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:demo="http://cpi.sap.com/demo"> 
       <soapenv:Header/> 
       <soapenv:Body> 
          <demo:Order_MT> 
             <orderNumber>1</orderNumber> 
          </demo:Order_MT> 
       </soapenv:Body> 
    </soapenv:Envelope>

**Step 11** :  Check the Message status in **Monitoring Window**. The Flow will be in **Failed** status with below shown error description.

#### EDITING ARTIFACT TO HANDLE EXCEPTION :

**Step 12** : Go back to the **Integration Flow**. Add an **Exception Subprocess** from the Pallet and place it inside Integration Process.

**Step 13** : It will Look as below.

**Step 14** :  Add a **Content Modifier** inside **Exception Subprocess**. In **_Message Body_** tab, Type as below. 

    <Result2> 
    ${exception.message}     ---> This line will catch Error Message thrown by integration Process. 
    Exception Subprocess in Action 
    </Result2>

**Step 15**: **Save** and **Deploy**. 

![](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-59-1024x329.png)

**Step 16** :  Make sure that your Flow is in **Started** state again.

**Step 17** : Go back to **Postman**. The settings used earlier will still be available. Just _**Click**_ on **Send**.

**Step 18** : You will get back the Response in Postman as below.  

![](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-57-1024x289.png)

From the Response Received, it is clear that the Exception Subprocess gives the Error as SOAP body. Where in it was included with fault message earlier. 

**Step 19** : The Integration Flow will now be in **Completed** state. This is because, we have caught and processed the exception successfully in Exception Subprocess.

**Step 20** : You can even get the response in [Step 18](#Step 18) directly to your Gmail Inbox by adding **Mail Receiver Adapter** as below. Refer my [Previous](https://recodehive.com/mail-receiver-adapter-in-sap-cpi-a-step-by-step-guide/) blog on how to configure Mail Receiver Adapter in SAP CPI to get the detailed Configuration steps.

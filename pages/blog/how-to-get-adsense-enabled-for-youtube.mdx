##### **WHAT IS GOOGLE ADSENSE, THE SIMPLE WAY TO UNDERSTAND!**

Google Adsense is an ad-network where youtube pays a share from the revenue they make by placing ads in your videos.

**HOW TO CREATE AN ADSENSE ACCOUNT AND APPLY?**

*   To create a Google AdSense account you must have a valid G-mail account then just search [www.googleadsense.com](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/adsense/start/) and [signup.](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/adsense/start/)
*   . Once you create the account using your Gmail you will get a confirmation mail from the Adsense team saying that “your account has been created”.

**SO NOW THE BIG QUESTION WHEN YOU WILL GET PAID?**

*   Once you meet the necessary requirements and have a working account and apply for monetization,
*   ads will start playing during your YouTube videos and your AdSense account will reflect the amount.

Now let’s understand a few **terms** you are going to encounter while doing all this process

*   Threshold: Your AdSense account must have a minimum amount of 100$ to withdraw, this amount varies in different countries.
*   address verification: when your Adsense account has earned 10$ you will get a pin from Google to verify your address that you are a real person.

*   what if you don’t get any code: if you haven’t got any pin: not to worry there is another option if you haven’t got your pin even after weeks of waiting then there will be a link in your AdSense account under address verification where you can send your government issued id like ( pan card, passport, aadhar, etc )
*   Once you verify the pin you will get an email that your account is now verified.
*   What is swift BIC and I don’t have it: please don’t worry if your bank does not have this swift code then the best thing you can do is just add any other branch swift code ( like some big city ) you will get the list online but should add of the same bank just branch can be different.

**Hurry!** We are all set to make some earnings by making content, once you do that you will get your payment when you reach 100$ and google sends payment on 21 of every month (it varies from time to time ) and your bank may take some time to add to your account.

#### Secure Messaging Apps

We all are very strict about our privacy, and if it comes to data privacy, we always choose secure platforms. When you search for the most secure messaging apps on Google then you will get the below list.

*   WhatsApp
*   Viber
*   Telegram
*   Wickr Me
*   Signal, etc.

#### Why Telegram ?

When comes to security Telegram holds more credibility than other Platforms. Two Russian brothers [Nikolai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Durov) and [Poval Durov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Durov), developed and released it in Aug 2013. Their only motive behind making this app to make public communications secure.

Durov once said that ” The main reason to build Telegram was to create means of communication that can’t be accessed by the Russian security agencies.”

#### Whatsapp vs Telegram

According to many online surveys, most people think that Telegram is more secure than **Whatsapp**. Its **secret chat** feature allows users to chat anonymously.

Telegram uses local storage over cloud storage to store these secret chats. Also, these chats are self-destructive, like Snapchat messages. But this option is not available as the default. You have to enable it.

Everything has some benefits and some issues. Telegram also has some problems; you can learn about these problems through this [article](https://bit.ly/38VCfTj).

#### The Big Story

Now let’s move to the big story. Recently, Telegram completed its **500 million** active users. On this occasion, Telegram’s founder **Pavel Durov** said they would introduce advertising in the app this year on public channels.

He also described the reason behind this decision. He said that he paid for the **expanses** of the company from his savings. Also, there is a significant need for appropriate funding to reach Telegram billions of users.

He also added that they are not going to sell the company. They want it to be independent as it was before. The new policy will not affect users, all the features are free as they were.

They’re also planning to add other features like **premium stickers**, **special tools for businesses**, monetization for large public channels. You can read the full announcement from the above screenshots.

#### **What is Share your world Campaign** ?ü§î

Have you ever wondered how AI detects photos in Google Search? Or how Google Lens recognizes the real-time objects and gives similar suggestions?

Object detection models allow robots to ‚Äòsee‚Äô and identify items in your photos and movies. Object detection has a wide range of practical uses. It has an impact on accessibility, picture and video search, and technology like augmented reality.

Human vision is both stunningly beautiful and complex. The ability of AI to see is improving all the time. However, it still falls short of a human‚Äôs intuitive perception in a few key areas.

It is critical that AI be trained to ‚Äòsee‚Äô and recognize items from various corners of the world in order for it to perform equally well for everyone, everywhere. Watch the below video how this is having an impact on many lives.

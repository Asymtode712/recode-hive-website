#### Introduction

Just the way we have different traffic rules in different parts of the world, EDI has its own standards in various parts. Any [EDI transaction](http://www.saptraininghq.com/electronic-data-interchange-edi-in-sap/#:~:text=Electronic%20Data%20Interchange%20\(EDI\)%20as,the%20goods%20that%20he%20requires.) is supposed to adhere to these Standards while doing business. In this post, we will overview EDI Types and standards.

#### EDI Standards

**ANSI X12**: American National Standards Institute XI2 is extensively used in the United States to Transmit the Data electronically. Every EDI Transaction happening in the United States must follow the [ANSI XI2](https://www.seeburger.com/info/what-is-ansi-x12/) format.

**UN/[EDIFACT](https://ecosio.com/en/blog/what-is-the-sap-idoc-format/#:~:text=SAP%20uses%20EDIFACT%2Dlike%20abbreviations,ANSI%20ASC%20X12%20and%20EDIFACT.)**: United Nations rules for Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and Transport is another standard used in regions outside the United States in Analogous to ANSI XI2.

**EANCOM :** European Article Number Communication is a subset of UN/EDIFACT standard which contains only the information related used in business applications rather than having full EDIFACT schema. It covers the information required by business entities to complete trade transaction.

#### [EDI Connections](http://www.saptraininghq.com/electronic-data-interchange-edi-in-sap/#:~:text=Electronic%20Data%20Interchange%20\(EDI\)%20as,the%20goods%20that%20he%20requires.)

Consider going from one city to another city. You have different modes of transport that you can choose from Bus, Car, Train, Flight etc. Similarly the EDI can be communicated from one Business entity to other using various available modes.

A Business Entity might connect with its Trading partners using one of the below mentioned connections based on its necessity and requirement.

**Direct EDI**: Also called Point Point EDI, used to communicate individually with Business Partners. It is efficient for a larger Business with a high volume of daily data exchange.

**EDI via VAN :** Also known as EDI Network Service Provider, used by business partners that do not accept the complexity of communication over varying protocols. VAN provides a common gateway to communicate with various partners.

**EDI via [AS2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AS2) :** Internet Communication protocol used to transmit data securely over internet. The Trading Partners associated will have their own dedicated AS2 address that is used for communication.

#### What is Sparklines Analysis in Excel

Sparkline will help us to insert a small chart into a single cell. To embed charts in a single cell, this can be inserted from the Insert tab. Select the cell you want to add and click on the Sparkline section in the insert tab. Select the range you want to add. For a large set of data, you can utilize the fill handle tab to drag the Sparkline to other cells rather than one at a time.

R square value range between 0 to 1. Here we got a value range of 0.92 which is very close to 1. You can try changing Linear to Exponential to see the R square value is changing or not.

An Exponential trend is good if our data is increasing at an same rate.

3.  Logarithmic – Precisely shows the rate of changes in the data ups or down

#### Overview

The aggregator is used to combine the incoming chunks of messages into one single message. The Aggregator will do multi-mapping while combining the messages.

There are two kinds of Aggregation Algorithm available.

1.  **Combine** : This will combine the incoming messages without any gurantee on the order of the messages.
2.  **Combine In Sequence** : This will combine the incoming messages in exact order.

#### Example

The incoming message is in the below format,

    <Order_MT> 
             <orderNumber>1</orderNumber> 
             <prodID>1</prodID>
             <supplierName>Walt</supplierName> 
             <productName>Timber</productName> 
             <lastProd>No</lastProd>
    </Order_MT> 

The requirement is to Aggregate the incoming messages having **different prodID** with **orderNumber=1** as a single message until **lastProd=Yes**.

The sample integration flow will look as below

#### Execution Steps

**Step 1**: Configure the **HTTPS sender adapte**r to create an endpoint to access the Integration Flow.

**Step 2**: Select **Aggregator** from **Routing** pallet and configure as below.

![Aggregator](https://recodehive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/image-10.png)

**Field** 

**Tab Name** 

**Value** 

**Explanation** 

**Correlation Expression (Xpath)** 

**Correlation** 

/Order\_MT/orderNumber 

Expression to the node relative to which the Aggregation should happen. Here we need to aggregate the message with the similar order number. 

**Incoming Format** 

**Aggregation Strategy** 

XML(Same Format) 

The format of the Incoming Message. To date, the only XML is allowed 

**Aggregation Algorithm** 

**Aggregation Strategy** 

Combine in Sequence 

Combine in sequence : Aggregated message will retain the original Sequence 

**Message Sequence Expression(Xpath)** 

**Aggregation Strategy** 

/Order\_MT/prodID 

Expression to the node based on which the sequence is determined.  Here we need a sequence based on prodID. 

**Last Message Condition (Xpath)** 

**Aggregation Strategy** 

/Order\_MT/lastProd=’Yes’ 

Expression with a value represents the end of the message. Here if the value in lastProd is Yes, then it indicates that it is the last message with that orderNumber.The Aggregation stops here.  

**Completion Timeout (min)** 

**Aggregation Strategy** 

60 

The time interval between two messages (idle time) before the Aggregation stops automatically. 

**Datastore Name** 

**Aggregation Strategy** 

AggregatorExample 

The name of the data Store where the individual messages are stored for aggregation.

**Step 3**: Use a **Content Modifier** step to add an incoming message as the body.

**Step 4** : **Save and Deploy** the flow.

**Step 5** : Copy the **EndPoint** from **Overview –> Manage Integration Content –> All**. Change the **Log Level to Trace** under **Log Configuration** as shown below. This will allow you to see the payload at runtime.

#### Testing the Flow using Postman

**Step 6**: Open the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) app.  

Keep the request in **GET** mode. 

Paste the Endpoint copied in Step 5 into the **URL tab**. 

In the **Authorization** tab, Choose **TYPE: Basic Auth** 

**Username**: Client ID 

**Password**: Client Secret 

Client Id and Client Secret you will get when you create Process Integration Runtime Instance during tenant setup. ( Refer **Step 34** of [this](https://recodehive.com/set-up-sap-cpi-tenant-in-trial-account-2/) post )

Paste the code given at the beginning of the article in the Body tab and Click on Send.

**Step 7**: In the Overview window, you will see the message is processed. At the same time, a **[Data Store](https://recodehive.com/data-store-operations-in-sap-cpi-step-by-step-guide/) is created** as below.

**Step 8**: Change data in Postman as below and click on send. Remember to keep the orderNumber same and lastProd= No.

**Step 9**: Check the Message processed and Data Store entry.

**Step 10**: Change the data again as Below and click on Send. This time make sure the orderNumber is the same and lastProd=Yes. This indicates that this will be the last message for aggregation.

**Step 11**: Now the Message will be processed Successfully and the aggregated message will be available. The Data Store entry will be deleted as the Aggregation is complete.

**_Note that 3 individual messages that we triggered along with the final Aggregated messages are processed Successfully. Click on Final Aggregated Message. Under Logs, Click on Trace whose Status is completed._**

**Step 12** : In the window that opens, Click on **END**. Under the **Message Content** tab, Click on **Payload**. You will see all three messages triggered are aggregated into a single message.
